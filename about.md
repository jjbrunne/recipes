My family has collected a set of recipes that we like to make.  Some are easier to make, some more involved.  Some are seasonal or made only for certain holidays.  Some recipes only one of my two kids will eat, while the other won't touch it.  My children's tastes have changed over time.

For these reasons and more, some recipes aren't in the weekly rotation.  However, I want to keep some variation in our eating.  I needed a place to store our recipes where I can browse through them periodically when looking for something we haven't had in a while.

Many of these recipes originated in various personal cooking blogs or recipe aggregation sites.  I was keeping these links in [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/), which has some advantages.

Pocket will store an *article* version of the site for offline reading.  This is a stripped down version without all the pictures and other unuseful stuff.  However, many of these recipe blogs are lousy with JavaScript, which can make Pocket offline copies useless (as opposed to just extremely annoying when viewed online... who wants a intrusive popup ads over their recipes?).  Also, the online versions would occassionally move or disappear, at which point the recipe was lost forever.

Pocket is also a *bookmark* utility.  I wanted a way to make notes and modify the recipes.

I was using [Keep](https://keep.google.com) which is great for many reasons.  However, it is a note taking app.  This makes it difficult to share with non-keep users.  It also does not have a read-only mode, so you risk accidentally modifying the recipe with fat fingers when using it to cook.

So, this site is an attempt to create a referenceable, web-viewable index of recipes that I can modify as needed intentionally.

The static site is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).  Because it is generated by Jekyll, I can use any vanilla Markdown editor to author the recipes.  I am using Obsidian to edit the files on my laptop and mobile, with changes pushed to Github.
