* 1 Cup Roma Tomato, Chopped
* 1/2 Cup  Onion, Roughly chopped

1. Spray your slow cooker with cooking spray and place the uncooked quinoa, corn, chickpeas, black beans, red pepper, tomato, onion cumin powder, garlic, salt, pepper and adobe sauce inside, stirring until well combined.
2. Pour in in the vegetable broth, stir well, and cover the pot. Cook on high for 3-4 hours. Mine was perfect at 3 hours, so check it and make sure the quinoa isnâ€™t burning.
3. Once cooked, season to taste with additional salt and pepper and garnish with cheese and cilantro.
