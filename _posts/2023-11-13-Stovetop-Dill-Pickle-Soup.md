Ingredients
--
* 5-1/2 cups chicken broth
* 1-3/4 lbs russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
* 2 cups chopped carrots, smaller dice
* 1 cup chopped dill pickles (smaller dice ~ about 3 large whole dills)
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 cup sour cream
* 1/4 cup water
* 2 cups dill pickle juice
* 1-1/2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning
* 1/2 teaspoon table salt
* 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Optional garnishes:
* sliced dill pickles, fresh dill and black pepper

Instructions
--


> [!NOTE] Watch the salt
> Not all pickle juice is the same.  Taste your soup before adding the final seasonings!


* In a large pot, combine broth, potatoes, carrots and butter. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are tender. Add pickles and continue to boil.  
- In a medium bowl, stir together flour, sour cream and water, making a paste. Vigorously whisk sour cream mixture (2 Tablespoons at a time) into soup. (This will also break up some of your potatoes which is okay. You might see some initial little balls of flour form, but between the whisking and boiling all will disappear. Don't panic.)
- Add pickle juice, Old Bay, salt, pepper and cayenne. Cook 5 more minutes and remove from heat. Serve immediately.
