> [!NOTE] This is the recipe I usually use
> This recipe makes a jelly-roll style pepperoni roll, rather than hand rolling each one.  It's faster and the kids seem to like it.


> [!NOTE] Needs pre-made dough
> Either follow the Pizza Dough recipe on this site, find your own Pizza Dough recipe, or just buy premade dough.  You can probably find some in the refrigerator/freezer section of the Jewel.

Ingredients
--
* 1 batch of  Pizza Dough (see separate recipe)
* 1/2 c. marinara sauce some for the rolls, some for dipping
* 8 oz. pepperoni slices (or more if you like)
* 1 c. mozzarella cheese shredded (or more if you like)
* 6 T. parmesan cheese

**Dips**
* Marina
* Ranch
* Whatever you like

Instructions
--

* Preheat oven to 425Â°.
* Divide dough into 2 equal balls (about 1 lb each). Roll each one out into a rectangle about 12 x 15 inches.
* On each rectangle, spread 2-4 tablespoons marinara sauce all the way to the edges.
	* You may be tempted to add more sauce.  Don't.  It will make a mess, the dough will get soggy, it won't cook right and you won't be able to cut it.
* Put a layer of pepperoni down on the sauce.
* Drizzle with shredded mozzarella cheese.
* Roll up each rectangle so that it forms a long roll (like a jelly roll or cinnamon roll).
* Pinch the edge of dough together to form a seam.
* Carefully cut each roll into 15 slices.
* (Optional) Place each slice on a pepperoni piece (the roll will be bigger than the pepperoni, that's ok). Sprinkle with parmesan cheese.
* Brush the rolls with melted butter.
* Bake on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper for 12-15 minutes at 425F or until done.

**Serve**

Serve with dips!
