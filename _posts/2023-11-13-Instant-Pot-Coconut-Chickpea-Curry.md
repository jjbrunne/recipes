Ingredients
--
* 1 tablespoon cooking oil
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 green chili pepper, slit into two (omit if too spicy)
* 1 cup onion, diced
* 1 teaspoon ginger, grated
* 1 teaspoon garlic , minced
* 3/4 cup tomato , chopped
* chickpeas, either:
	* 2 14 oz cans
	* 1 cup dried, soaked in water for 4 hours or overnight
* 1 1/4 cup water

**Spices**
* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1/2 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder, mild or paprika, adjust to taste
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon salt

**To Finish**
* 1 cup coconut milk , canned
* cilantro leaves, chopped, to garnish

Instructions
--
* Add all the ingredients and spices in the order listed in the instant pot steel insert (except from the _To Finish_ group).
* Close the lid with vent in sealing position. Set the instant pot on bean/chili mode for 30 minutes on high pressure.
* When the instant pot beeps, let the pressure release naturally. If it is not released completely in 20 minutes, release the pressure manually and open the lid.
* Add the coconut milk and stir well. Set the instant pot on saute mode and let the curry simmer for about 7-8 minutes. This will thicken the curry and give it a wonderful creamy consistency.
* Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve over rice.


> [!NOTE] Pot-In-Pot
> The original recipe has an option for making rice _Pot-In-Pot_ which is evidently cooking rice inside a pot inside the Instant Pot. 
> I usually make rice separately so I left this out.
