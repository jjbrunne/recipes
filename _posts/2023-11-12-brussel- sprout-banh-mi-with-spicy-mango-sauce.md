Instructions
--

For the roasted Brussels sprouts with lime vinaigrette:
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
- Spread out the Brussels sprouts and chopped shallot on a baking sheet and drizzle very lightly with oil (I used refined coconut oil). Sprinkle generously with salt, and with black pepper to taste.
- Roast for 15 minutes, stir, and return to the oven for another 10-15 minutes or until crisped on the outside and tender (but not mushy) on the inside.
- Whisk together the lime juice, coconut sugar, and soy sauce, and stir it into the Brussels sprouts mixture.

For the spicy mango sauce:
- In a blender, puree the mango, sriracha, and vinegar until smooth. Salt and add more sriracha to taste. Alternatively, substitute this sauce with spicy vegan mayo.

For the Brussels sprout banh mis:
- Slice one of the baguette pieces most of the way open and spread mango sauce onto one half.
- Load up the bread generously with the Brussels sprout and shallot mixture, and top with fresh sliced veggies and cilantro as desired.
- Finish the sandwich with a big squeeze of fresh lime juice.
