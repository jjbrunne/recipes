**TIP: Make the pasta the night before to cut down on time to serve. (then skip step 2)**

1. Combine broth, tomatoes, kidney beans, onion, carrots, celery, green beans, zucchini, garlic, parsley, oregano, salt, thyme, and pepper in a 6-quart slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.
3. Stir macaroni and spinach into the slow cooker; cover and cook for 15 more minutes.
4. Serve with parmesan cheese on top.
