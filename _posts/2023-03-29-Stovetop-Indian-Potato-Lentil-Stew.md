Ingredients
--
-   1 Tbsp garlic-infused olive oil
-   1 Tbsp ginger root, peeled and grated
-   3 1/4 tsp curry powder
-   1 1/2 tsp garam masala
-   1 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes, undrained
-   1 cup water
-   1 potato with skin, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
-   1 medium sweet potato, with skin, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
-   2 medium carrots, cut into 1/4 inch pieces
-   1 15.5-ounce can lentils
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   1 1/2 cup green beans, fresh or frozen, cut into 1-inch pieces
-   1/2 cup canned coconut milk


Instructions
--
1.  In a stockpot or large saucepan, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the ginger and stir for 30 seconds.
    
2.  Add the curry powder and garam masala and stir continuously until spices are fragrant and have turned a shade darker, about 1 minute.  
    
3.  Add the tomatoes and water and scrape the pan to loosen any spices that have stuck to the bottom.  
    
4.  Add the potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, lentils, and salt. Cover the pot, bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat. Simmer until the potatoes are nearly cooked through but are not quite fork tender, about 12 to 15 minutes.
    
5.  Add the green beans, replace the lid, and continue cooking until green beans are tender and potatoes and carrots are soft about 5 minutes.
    
6.  Stir in the coconut milk and simmer uncovered for about 2 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
