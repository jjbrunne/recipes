* 1 Tbsp garam masala
* 1 tsp coriander
* ½ tsp turmeric

Instructions

1. Heat butter over medium heat.
2. Add onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
3. Place onions in a slow cooker with garlic, ginger, spices, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, lemon zest and 1 cup of the heavy cream. Stir to combine.
4. Add chicken, stir and cook on LOW 4-5 hours.
5. Combine remaining cream with cornstarch. Stir half of the cream into the sauce and let sit for a few minutes to thicken. Add remaining cream mixture if needed.
6. Cover and cook 15 minutes more.
7. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve over basmati rice.

Coconut milk can be substituted for heavy cream.

> This was kind of bland.  Even substituting Greek yogurt for heavy cream did not help.
> Also, Charlotte won't eat this.
