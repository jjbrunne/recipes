- 6 cups water
- One 28 ounce can diced tomatoes
- 1 large onion, diced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 Tablespoons fresh grated ginger
- 1 Tablespoon turmeric
- 3 green cardamom pods
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 teaspoons each: cumin seeds, mustard seeds, onion seeds (nigella), fenugreek seeds (see notes)

- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- For serving:
- Hot cooked brown rice
- cilantro, optional

Instructions
--
1. Place red lentils and yellow split peas into a large bowl and cover with water. Let soak for a few minutes and swish to wash the lentils and split peas. Drain well and rinse. Place in a slow cooker and add the 6 cups water. Add the diced tomatoes, onion, garlic, ginger, turmeric, cardamom pods, bay leaf, salt and black pepper.
2. Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add all of the seeds to the pan. Shake the pan while on the heat, or use a wooden spoon to stir, while toasting the seeds. When they smell fragrant, remove from heat and transfer to the slow cooker. (It will probably bubble up a bit as the hot seed hit the liquid.) Stir well to combine all ingredients. Place lid on slow cooker and let cook on high for 4-5 hours or low for 8-10 hours.
3. Remove lid after cooking time and stir. Taste and if lentils are not soft, cook for another 30-60 minutes, if needed. Add more salt and pepper, if needed.
4. To serve – Ladle the daal over brown rice and top with a squeeze of fresh lemon, cilantro, and more seeds, if desired.
