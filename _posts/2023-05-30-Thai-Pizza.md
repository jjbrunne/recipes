Ingredients
--
- 1 Boboli Pizza Crust
- 1 small can pineapple tidbits, drained
- 1 good slice of red onion
- 1/4 cup shredded carrots
- 3 slices basil leaves
- 1/2 cup diced cilantro
- about a cup of shredded mozzarella

Sauce
- For the Sauce
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 1/2 c of peanut butter
- 1 tbsp Sriracha
- 1 tbsp lite soy sauce
- 1 tbsp red pepper flakes
- 1/4 c chopped onion
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1/3 cup water


Instructions
--

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
2. Heat sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until it comes to temperature.
3. Add garlic, onions, sriracha, and red pepper flakes, and sautee until the onions are clear.
4. Add remaining ingredients and stir until bubbling. Don't turn the heat up too high or the peanut butter can get a bit cranky.
5. Remove from heat, set aside.
6. Place your pizza crust on a pan or a piece of foil. Spread the peanut sauce almost to the edge.  You can use all the sauce or not.  Whatever you like.  
7. Sprinkle on the cheese.  Don't go too crazy with the cheese or it will overpower the Thai flavors. 
8. Spread the rest of the toppings on the pizza however you like, with the exception of the cilantro. 
9. Assuming you're using my suggested crust, place it in the oven and bake it for about fifteen minutes. 
10. Remove it from the oven, and let it stand for about ten minutes before sprinkling the cilantro on the top.
