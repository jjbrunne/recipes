Ingredients
--
* 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into bite-sized 1‚Äù cubes
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch (3 tablespoons for an extra crispy coating)
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* Vegetable oil
* 1 cup pineapple chunks
* 2 sweet bell peppers (any color), deseeded and chopped
* sesame seeds for garnish (optional)

Sauce:
* 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
* 1/4 cup chicken broth
* 3 tablespoons tomato paste or ketchup
* 3 tablespoons honey or brown sugar
* 1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 2 teaspoons oyster sauce (can substitute soy sauce)
* 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
* 2 garlic cloves minced
* 1/2 teaspoon fresh ginger minced

Corn starch slurry:
* 2 tablespoons corn starch
* 3 tablespoons cool water

Instructions
--

* Toss the chicken, cornstarch salt, and black pepper, then set aside.
	* Either shake-and-bake style in a bag
	* Or chicken tender style in a bowl.
* Make the sauce In a small bowl, whisk together all the ingredients for the sauce, set aside.

**For Slow Cooker Method:**

* Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. (You can skip this stove-top step if you prefer or are in a pinch. Just add chicken directly to slow cooker. Chicken will not have that crispy coating)
* Cook chicken about 2-3 minutes on each side, until lightly browned. Transfer chicken into the slow cooker and pour sauce over top.
* Cover and cook on LOW for 2.5 - 4 hours or HIGH for 1.5 - 3 hours. (SEE NOTES)
* About 30 minutes before serving, whisk together the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and stir into the slow cooker. Add the pineapples and bell peppers into the pot. Cover and cook on HIGH for another 20-30 minutes or until the sauce has thickened up and the vegetables are tender. (if your slow cooker is not hot enough to thicken the sauce - pour sauce into a pot and heat on stovetop on high to thicken sauce or you can just skip the cornstarch slurry instead)
* Sprinkle with sesame seeds, green onions and serve over rice, quinoa or zoodles, if desired.

**For Instant Pot Method:**

* Turn Instant Pot to SAUTE (skip this step and just cook on MANUAL or PRESSURE COOK (high) for 5 minutes if you are in a pinch or prefer. The chicken won't have that crispy coating.) Allow pan to heat up for a few minutes then add oil. Cook chicken in batches (placing the browned chicken on a paper-towel-lined plate) about 3-4 minutes on each side, until lightly browned. Once all the chicken is browned, add back to the Instant Pot and pour sauce over top.
* Close and seal Instant Pot and set the valve to sealing.
* Press MANUAL or PRESSURE COOK (high) and set for 3 minutes. Once the 3 minutes is up and the Instant Pot beeps, allow to naturally release for 15-20 minutes. Open lid and transfer chicken to a large serving plate or bowl.
* Return inner pot back to the Instant Pot. Press the SAUTE button and add additional oil as needed. Toss in the pineapple and bell peppers and cook for 2-3 minutes, until tender.
* Combine the corn starch with water and stir into the Instant Pot. Allow the sauce to bubble and thicken up. Add the chicken back to the Instant Pot and cook for a minute or two until everything is heated through.
* Sprinkle with sesame seeds, green onions and serve over rice, quinoa or zoodles, if desired.
