- Add the split peas, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, bay leaves, smoked paprika, salt, broth, water and the ham or ham bone (if using) to a 6-quart slow cooker, stirring to combine.
- Cover and cook on high for 5-6 hours or low for 7-8. Do not remove the lid during the cooking time.
- Uncover, add the red wine vinegar, and stir to combine. Remove the ham bone (if using) and discard. Taste and add additional salt or vinegar if desired. Serve with toppings of your choice.
