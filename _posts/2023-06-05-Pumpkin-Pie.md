Ingredients
--
- one 15-ounce can (425g) **pumpkin puree***
- 3 large **eggs**
- 1 and 1/4 cups (250g) packed light or dark **brown sugar**
- 1 Tablespoon (8g) **cornstarch**
- 1/2 teaspoon **salt**
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons **ground cinnamon**
- 1/2 teaspoon **ground ginger***
- 1/4 teaspoon ground or freshly grated **nutmeg***
- 1/8 teaspoon **ground cloves***
- 1/8 teaspoon fresh ground **black pepper**
- 1 cup (240ml) **heavy cream**
- 1/4 cup (60ml) **milk**

Instructions
--
* Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
* Par-bake the crust for 10 minutes of desired
* Make the pumpkin pie filling: Whisk the pumpkin, 3 eggs, and brown sugar together until combined. Add the cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, heavy cream, and milk. Vigorously whisk until everything is combined.
* Pour pumpkin pie filling into the warm crust. Only fill the crust about 3/4 of the way up.
* Bake the pie until the center is almost set, about 55-60 minutes give or take. A small part of the center will be wobbly—that’s ok. After 25 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown. Check for doneness at minute 50, and then 55, and then 60, etc.
* Once done, transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow to cool completely for at least 3 hours before garnishing and serving.
* Serve with whip cream or ice cream.
