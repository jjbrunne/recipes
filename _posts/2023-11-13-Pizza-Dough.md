Ingredients
--
* 2-2 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour OR bread flour 
* 1 packet instant yeast (2 ¼ teaspoon)
* 1 ½ teaspoons sugar
* ¾ teaspoon salt
*  ⅛-¼ teaspoon garlic powder and/or dried basil leaves (optional)
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil + additional
* ¾ cup warm water

Instructions

**Proofing the Yeast**
Evidently this step is optional.
* Put 3/4 cup of warm water in a bowl.  Not too hot or you will kill the yeast.
* Sprinkle yeast packet into water in the bowl and let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.

**Making the Dough**
* Combine 1 cup of flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. If desired, add garlic powder and dried basil at this point as well.
	* NOTE: If you've proofed the yeast, skip the yeast here.  Just pour the proofed yeast and water in the next step.
* Add olive oil and warm water and use a wooden spoon to stir well very well.
	* NOTE: If you proofed the yeast, add the water and yeast from the bowl here instead of adding warm water.
* Gradually add another 1 cup of flour. Add any additional flour as needed, stirring until the dough is forming into a cohesive, elastic ball and is beginning to pull away from the sides of the bowl. The dough should be slightly sticky but still manageable with your hands.
* Drizzle a separate, large, clean bowl generously with olive oil and use a pastry brush to brush up the sides of the bowl.
* Lightly dust your hands with flour and form your pizza dough into a round ball and transfer to your olive oil-brushed bowl. Use your hands to roll the pizza dough along the inside of the bowl until it is coated in olive oil, then cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place.
* Allow dough to rise for 30 minutes or until doubled in size. 
* Once the dough has risen, use your hands to gently deflate it and transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth (about 3-5 times).
* **Optional:** Let it rise again for 30 minutes

If you are using the dough for something else, like Pepperoni Rolls, stop here.

**Making the Pizza Crust**
* Use either your hands or a rolling pin to work the dough into 12" circle.
* Transfer dough to a parchment paper lined pizza pan and either pinch the edges or fold them over to form a crust.
* Drizzle additional olive oil (about a Tablespoon) over the top of the pizza and use your pastry brush to brush the entire surface of the pizza (including the crust) with olive oil. 
* Use a fork to poke holes all over the center of the pizza to keep the dough from bubbling up in the oven.
* Add desired sauce and toppings, then bake at 425F for 13-15 minutes or until toppings are golden brown.
* Slice and serve.
